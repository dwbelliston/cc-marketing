# Wealthbox

You have worked hard to setup your CRM and keep your contacts up to date their. Nice job! Let's take advantage of that effort and connect CurrentClient to Wealthbox. Everyday, CurrentClient will copy your contacts core information so you can message your clients in CurrentClient.

As message activity occurs in CurrentClient, we will send a daily summary as a note to the client's record in Wealthbox.

## Step to connect

Creating the integration with CurrentClient you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Log into CurrentClient and navigate to the dashboard.

2. On the top right of the navigation bar, click on the 'gear' icon and then click on 'Settings'.

3. Once in Settings, click on "Connectors" on the left side bar.

4. Once in Connectors, click on 'Add Connector" and select the Wealthbox CRM option.

5. Now, login to Wealthbox and navigate to your Wealthbox CRM settings. Go to the section in settings called “API Access” and create a new Access Token.

6. Navigate back to CurrentClient, and put the api token you created in Wealthbox inside the CurrentClient input.

7. Optionally, you can add a filter based on Client Status to limit which clients will be synced to CurrentClient.

8. Continue the process to create this connector.

9. Once created, click on 'CRM Sync' on the left side of the page.

10. Once in CRM Sync settings page, you will select the connector you just created and enable the sync and save.

Nice job! CurrentClient will now bring over your clients information automatically.
