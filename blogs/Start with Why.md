# Starting a company with a Why

Starting a company is often fueled by a personal experience or a realization that sparks a desire for change. In my case, it all began with a simple conversation I had with my grandma about her insurance agent. This conversation has given me motivation to build CurrentClient, a company focused on providing professionals with the tools they need to be hyper-available for their clients.

## The Encounter with Grandma

One day, during a visit to my grandma's house, I asked her about her insurance agent and how often he interacted with her. She replied saying it had been a while since she heard from him, and whenever she did reach out, he seemed to be on vacation. Now, the agent had done a great job getting her great coverage and he certainly doesn't need to asking her how she is doing every day. It did get me wondering though, what if once a quarter that agent could at least just text her and ask if shes good and if there is anything he can do to help.

## The Power of the One

It dawned on me that while we often aspire to have a large stage and numerous clients, there is immense power in focusing on the one. Building a strong, personal relationship with clients is crucial, especially in professional services. It is not just about completing transactions but fostering meaningful connections that go beyond the exchange of services.

## Emphasizing the Relationship

In today's fast-paced world, where everyone is constantly busy, it's easy to overlook the importance of maintaining strong client relationships. As professionals, we can sometimes fall into the trap of treating our clients as mere transactions. However, true success lies in nurturing and investing in these relationships.

## The Right Tools for Connectivity

Realizing that many busy professionals struggle to stay connected with their clients, I saw an opportunity to bridge this gap. That's when the idea of CurrentClient was born. Our mission is to provide professionals with intuitive and efficient tools that empower them to be hyper-available for their clients.

## CurrentClient's Vision

At CurrentClient, we believe that the key to client satisfaction and loyalty lies in consistent and meaningful communication. Our platform offers a range of features that make it easy for professionals to check in, even if only briefly, with their clients. From automated reminders to personalized messaging, we strive to enhance the client experience and strengthen the bonds between professionals and their clients.

Starting CurrentClient was a direct result of a personal experience that made me realize the significance of staying connected with clients. By focusing on building relationships rather than just completing transactions, we aim to empower busy professionals with the tools they need to be hyper-available for their clients. Through CurrentClient, we strive to bridge the gap between professionals and their clients, creating a stronger, more fulfilling professional-client relationship.‚Äç
